Tic Tac Toe Game in Ruby

Version 2.0

Changes from 1.0:


Version 1.1

Generally played through console, but has some capabilities to do a non-console based UI.

Changes from original:

	Cleaned up the console display board.
	
	Added some checks for correct user input. Program will re-query user if submitted incorrect input instead of skipping turns.
	
	User can now select custom markers for themselves or computer. Only works with characters that are not 0-8.
	
	Changed some variable names to be more sensible.
	
	Attempted to refine the computer's move selection process to be more difficult.
	
	Displayed messages saying whose turn it was and what the computer selected.
	
	Displays game-over messages such as tie or win/loss.
	
	Decoupled a few functions from each other to make it more modular.
